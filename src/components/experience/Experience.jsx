        <h3> A proud girl from the province of Rosario, Agusan del Sur. Growing up in a close-knit community has taught me the values of resilience, 
          hard work, and the importance of family. As the eldest of three siblings, 
          I am driven by a strong desire to create a better future for my loved ones.
           My journey is inspired by my roots, and every step I take is a testament to 
           the dreams I hold for myself and those who believe in me. This portfolio is 
           a reflection of my dedication, passion, and unwavering commitment to building a brighter tomorrow.</h3>
